:wave: Hi, I'm a multi-talented personality in the tech and gaming communities. As a developer advocate :avocado:, I have the privledge of sharing my knowledge and experience through articles, presentations, and even Twitch streams. I have written articles on technical topics, and spoken at conferences and events on the importance of collaboration, community building, and the future of work. I'm also a respected leader in the hackathon community, having won, organised, and mentored at numerous events. I'm a successful entrepreneur and founder, having co-founded several companies â€“ including an artificial intelligence company. You'll often catch me at an event, speaking on stage, or on a live stream!

And yes my name was Michelle "MishManners" Mannering, and now I am Michelle "MishManners" Duke after getting married in December 2023. We couldn't be happier. You might even catch my player 2 on a live stream or at an event with me :heart:
